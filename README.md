# Raspberry Pi-Controlled Drink Dispenser with Web Interface

## Project Description
This project features a sophisticated drink dispenser system controlled by a Raspberry Pi, providing seamless integration between hardware control and software functionality. The core of the system is a web application built using Flask, which serves as the user interface for interaction and operation.

### Key Features

#### 1. Raspberry Pi Control
Utilizing the versatile capabilities of the Raspberry Pi, the dispenser system manages the precise dispensing of various drinks. The Raspberry Pi handles hardware interfacing, controlling pumps and sensors to ensure accurate drink composition.

#### 2. Web Application
The system includes a Flask-based web server which hosts the user interface. This web application is accessible from any standard web browser, providing users the convenience of operating the dispenser remotely.

#### 3. Drink Selection Interface
The web application features multiple pages, each dedicated to a specific drink offered by the dispenser. These pages include detailed descriptions of each drink, along with a list of ingredients, helping users make informed choices about their selections.

#### 4. Interactive Requests Handling
Users can make drink requests directly through the web application. These requests are sent to the Raspberry Pi via the Flask server, which processes and executes the drink dispensing commands in real-time.

#### 5. Ingredient Management
The system provides information on the availability and quantity of ingredients, allowing for efficient management of resources and timely refilling.

### System Flow

- The user accesses the drink selection interface through the web browser.
- Upon selecting a drink, the user can view the ingredients and submit a request.
- The Flask server receives the request and communicates with the Raspberry Pi to initiate the dispensing process.
- The Raspberry Pi activates the appropriate pumps and mechanisms to dispense the selected drink according to the specified recipe.

This project effectively combines the power of Raspberry Pi with the flexibility of Flask, creating a user-friendly and efficient drink dispensing system suitable for home or commercial use.
